# About
Ensuring the availability of blood is crucial for healthcare systems worldwide. However, managing blood banks efficiently can be a complex and demanding task. To address this challenge we propose the development of an online blood bank management system that streamlines operations, enhances donor management, and improves overall efficiency.

The system facilitates seamless donor registration, real-time inventory tracking, and quick identification of suitable donors. It also enables blood transfers between banks to ensure timely access to necessary blood types. Additionally, an integrated Azure Health ChatBot provides personalized guidance on the health conditions of the patient wherein any individual can interact with the bot.
